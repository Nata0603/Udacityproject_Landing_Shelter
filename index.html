        <p>Ask anyone who has adopted a pet and they’ll share with you their story of love, fun and companionship. Why? Because shelter pets are amazing!</p>
          <p>The Shelter "Make Friends" is the result of a collaborative effort of a few friends, who .
          Our goal is to help you find a new friend and make sure that each our pet finds loving homes.</p>
        <p>Our mission is clear: to take responsibility for each and every orphaned, abandoned, abused or neglected dog and cat which reaches our doors; to take them in and shelter them; to provide the best medical and physical care possible for them; to nurture them back to health if need be; and finally to place them into warm, loving, adoptive homes where they can enjoy the lives they deserve.</p>
        <p>  Adopting a pet from a shelter or rescue is a win-win, for you and the pet. So, what are you waiting for? Begin your search for cats and dogs available for adoption near you today.</p>

        <h2>Pets</h2>
        <p>Visit our location to meet our adoptable animals. All of our animals are spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, and ready to start the next chapter of their lives. Our knowledgeable adoption specialists are happy to help you find the pet that matches your home and lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Dogs and cats who are taken into the care of shelters and rescue groups each year find themselves homeless through no fault of their own; “moving” and “landlord issues” are the top reasons people give up their pets.
        This means shelters and rescues are full of loving, spayed or neutered, vaccinated and often trained pets who are just waiting to meet you! By adopting a cat or dog from a shelter or rescue, you can rest assured that you have not supported the puppy mill industry.</p>
